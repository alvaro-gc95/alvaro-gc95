### Hi! I'm √Ålvaro. 
I'm currently doing an industrial PhD in interMET Sistemas y Redes SME. I'm also part of the climate variability research group TROPA, in Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Spain).
I'm interested in mountain meteorology and climate models, specially in snow modelization at very-high resolutions.
